# SchoolMap

## Project Overview
Seeing a need in my school, which at the time relied on static maps postered around the school that were generally difficult to navigate, I sought out to find a digital solution in the form of an online interactive school map. The aim of this project was to make it easier for students, staff, and visitors to navigate the school through a clearer and more user-friendly interface.

### Key features 
- Interactive map interface
- Map markers with room info
- Colour key for different subjects
- Help function
- Zooming and Panning capabilities

### Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Map Integration: Leaflet JS

### Usage
1. Use the interactive map to explore the school campus.
2. Click on map markers to get detailed information about specific rooms.
3. Refer to the color key to easily identify different departments or subjects.

### Future Improvements
While the project is complete, future improvements could include:
- Adding a search bar for easier location finding.
- Incorporating real-time updates for events or closures.
- Integrating school schedules to show classroom availability.
- Adding accessibility features to support users with disabilities.
